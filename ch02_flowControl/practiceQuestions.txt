1. What are the two values of the Boolean data Type? How do you write them?
    True or False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
    and, or, and not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
    True or False   = True*
    True or True    = True
    False or False  = False **
    False or True   = True ** 
    True and True   = True
    True and False  = False **
    False and True  = False
    Flase and False = Flase **
    not True        = False **
    not False       = True **

4. What do the following exporessions evaluate to?
    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
        True and False = False
    not (5 > 4)
        not False = Flase *
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
        True or Flase = True *
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
        not (True or False) = False
    (True and True) and (True == False)
        Flase
    (not False) or (not True)
        True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
    >, <, ==, >=, <=, ==

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
    equal to operator evaluates, assignment operator assigns

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
    condition if an if or while statement. would use it when you need to loop thru something or evaluate something

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10: #first block
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5: #second block
        print('bacon')
    else: #third block
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

print('Please enter a number:')
spam = input()
if spam == str(1):
    print('Hello')
elif spam == str(2):
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
    Ctrl + c or CMD + c

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
    break statements: will immediately exit the while loop cause early
    continue statements: are used inside loops. program exewcution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loop's condition

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
    range(10) will evaluate the number 10 10 times
    range(0, 10) will evaluate starting at zero and ending at 10
    range(0, 10, 1) will evaluate starting at zero, ending in 10, in increments of 1

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
    #for loop
    i = 1
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(i)
    
    #while loop
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(i)
        i = i + 1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
    spam.bacon()
